An HTTP request is a message sent by a client to a server asking for a resource, such as a web page or file.

The status code observed was 200 OK, which means the request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource without any issues. ​

One thing I learned about Git today is the importance of using feature branches for isolated changes. ​ This workflow allows for better organization, collaboration, and tracking of changes before merging them into the main branch. ​ It also makes it easier to review and test updates systematically.
